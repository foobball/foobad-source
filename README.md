# foobad's source

i am obviously not going to provide support with this! 

to start the bot:
- download nodejs
- run `npm install`
- edit `config.json` with the provided info
- run `tsc && npm start`

foobad should then start and do everything it's supposed to !!!! have an issue? fix it urself i'm done
